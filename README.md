# OpenEdge ABL language support for VS Code

This version is only temporary - first (hopefuly) usable version of syntax highlighting for vscode.

It is a work in progress. Will be completely rewritten in near future to maximize the utilization of tmLanguage possibilities.

## Features worth mentioning

- Nested comments
- Limited support for abbreviations - only minimal and full versions of commands (eg. `char` and `character`, nothing in between)

## Future plans
- Fully utilize the tmLanguage format
- Fully support abbreviations
- Extract the `tmLanguage` grammar for use in SublimeText
